# 30 Days React Challenge

Welcome to the 30 Days React Challenge! ðŸš€

## Overview

The 30 Days React Challenge is a hands-on coding challenge designed to help you build and strengthen your React skills. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with React or an experienced developer aiming to enhance your proficiency, this challenge is tailored for you.

## How It Works

Each day, you will receive a new challenge that focuses on a specific aspect of React development. The challenges are designed to be progressively more challenging, allowing you to gradually build your skills over the course of 30 days. You will be working on real-world projects, implementing key React concepts, and exploring best practices.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-days-react-challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd 30-days-react-challenge
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser, and you can start working on the challenges.

## Structure

The project is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you will find a README file describing the challenge for that day and a starter codebase to get you started. Additionally, there may be some resources or references to help you complete the challenge.
